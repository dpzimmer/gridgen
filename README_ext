This fork of NOAA-EMC/gridgen comprises experimental code provided as-is and placed into the public domain.

The repository extends the original package by the addition of functions using the 'ext_' prefix, as well as 
applies any required adjustments or patches to the existing code... the main new function being 'ext_create_grid'.

## Status

2023-03-31 - initial commit of scavenged in-house code.
           - only superficial testing performed.
           - overall review required.
           - revisit wet-point-only interpolation/averaging as an option, and document rationale.
           - TODO: inherently handle grids requested in negative longitude ranges.
