This fork of NOAA-EMC/gridgen is based upon code developed at Baird & Associates which has been 
placed into the public domain as-is, with the authorization of Baird staff members Douglas Scott 
(Principal) and Don Zimmer (Associate Pricinpal) on 2023-03-31.

This repository extends functionality by the addition of functions using the 'ext_' prefix, as well as 
any required adjustments or patches to the existing code... the main new function being 'ext_create_grid'.

## Status

2023-03-31 - initial commit of scavenged in-house code.
           - only superficial testing performed.
           - overall review required.
           - assessment of recent changes in NOAA generate_grid required.
