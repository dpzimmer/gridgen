This fork of NOAA-EMC/gridgen is based upon code developed at Baird & Associates which has been 
placed into the public domain as-is, with the authorizations of Baird staff members Douglas Scott 
(Principal) and Don Zimmer (Associate Pricinpal) on 2023-03-31.

This fork adds functionality by the addition of added functions using the 'ext_' prefix, as well as 
any required adjusments or patches to the existing code.  The main function being 'ext_create_grid'.
